# Fudo - Fucking Do lists

Fudo is three list to-do application. You make new Fudo and it will be added to the To-Do list. When you start doing a Fudo it will be moved to Doing list. Then once you have completed Fudo in Doing list it will be moved to Done list. 

Fudo is built using PyGTK and Glade with Python3.

```
git clone https://github.com/TMKCodes/Fudo.git
cd Fudo
python fudo.py
```

When you start doing a Fudo from the To-Do list you will start a timer for the Fudo. You can pause the timer if you want to do something else. When Fudo timer is active or paused it will reside in the Doing list. Once you stop the timer the Fudo will be moved to Done list.
